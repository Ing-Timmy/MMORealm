		<p> Welcome to MMORealm, a website where all people interested in the MMORPG genre can come together to communicate and learn more on their favorite or new games.</p>
		
		
		<p> My name is Timmy Ing, and I have been playing MMORPGs on and off since 2006. I was a child, just in elementary school, and I remember the experiences I had with my first MMORPG, RuneScape.
		It was also my first experience being connected to other people before over the internet, and as a result, I realized the amazing feeling of community and achievement one receives through MMORPGs.
		Since then, I've played countless MMORPGs and now I am here to give you an outlet to continue your experiences.</p>
